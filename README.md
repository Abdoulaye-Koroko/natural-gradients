# Natural gradient-based optimization methods for deep learning

## Overview

This repository provides implementation of several natural gradient-based optimization methods for training deep neural networks. It include the following methods (see in references section for more on each method)

- [ ] KFAC
- [ ] Two-level KFAC
- [ ] KPSVD
- [ ] Deflation
- [ ] KFAC Corrected
- [ ] Lanczos
- [ ] Exact natural gratient with full Fisher matrix or with block-diagonal Fisher matrix
